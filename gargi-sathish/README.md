## Textbook

If you should need a textbook then we recommend [**Algorithms**](http://algorithmics.lsi.upc.edu/docs/Dasgupta-Papadimitriou-Vazirani.pdf) by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou and Vazirani because it prioritizes brevity and a draft is available for free.

## Assessment and Grading

Assessment will be based on the following activities:
- Exam 1 (E1), which will be a written, individual exam;
- Exam 2, which will have two parts:
    - (E2P1) In Part 1, students will work in teams of 4 to solve an assigned problem and establish its correctness and runtime complexity (on paper).
    - (E2P2) In Part 2, two groups will work together to implement a solution (in JavaScript) after comparing their approaches. They will then present their work with a demo and a discussion of lessons learnt.

| Type of Assessment | Weight |
| ------------------ | :-------: | 
| E1 | 40% | 
| E2P1 | 30% |
| E2P2 | 30% |
